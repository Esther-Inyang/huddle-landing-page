## My process

### Built with

- React + Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

- I learned how to properly style the containers to wrap the elements and align them properly.
- I also learned how to add the curved edges background images to blend with the background color and styles of the section.
- I learned that putting the background image in the public folder makes it easier to use than putting it in the assets folder.
- I learned that it is best to use the curved images as a normal image so that the background color can be changed to white. Using it as a background image doesn't allow background color change in svg images.

### Continued development

I want to add some animations to the huddle images and texts to give them some life

### Useful resources

[React icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) - This helped me add easily styled icons to my project.
